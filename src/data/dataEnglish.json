        "paragraph1": "I am a passionate Software Development student, currently in the final semesters of a program that will qualify me as a Software Development Technologist at the Digital University Institution of Antioquia. I am fluent in both Spanish and English and have completed the Oracle ONE Bootcamp. My enthusiasm for technology and my dedication to learn are making me a promising professional in the field of software development ðŸš€.",
        "paragraph2": "I started as an ordinary student with some good affinity for English, which led me to participate in  many temporary customer service jobs to later become a self-taught learner of WordPress, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. All of this was made possible with the knowledge I gained at my alma mater, also in Oracle Next Education (ONE) virtual bootcamp, and of course, with my own dedication and discipline in understanding key concepts that allow me to integrate artificial intelligence as a tool."
